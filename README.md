# bulk_signature_verification
Leveraging technology, it is possible to collect signatures from people using a touch screen, then storing the signature as a hash code, verification can be made just by a simple search to determine if the signature is attached to a given database(pdf, hand written etc). A simple machine learning could check for potential mismatches and even more so potential matches or fraud.
